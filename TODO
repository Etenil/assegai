* Rethink the dependency injector to actually inject dependencies...
The injector mustn't be static but an instanciable object that is created
by the framework and handles all subsequent dependency requests.

Objects need to be registered to the injector via a configuration file,
PHP or text.

Dependency injection for Assegai is to function exclusively by the
constructor. There is to be no expensive reflective inspection on objects.
Instead, the registration of an object bears with it the relevant 
information about the constructor arguments.

* Migrate Assegai to PSR-0
* Separate the routing logic from the engine
* Make sure the engine does not have dependencies
